# Command line tips

**New!** I've written a command line zine (for OSX only, at the moment) to walk
you through learning the command line. 

See it here:

It's available as a printable, an online PDF, online HTML, and other versions.
Windows/Linux coming soon.

Other than that, here are the really basic commands that'll help you
navigate (assuming you're on a Linux-based system, like Mac OS, or using the
Linux Subsystem for Windows):

* **ls**: Shows the contents of the directory you're currently in.
* **cd FOLDERNAME**: Changes directories. For example: `cd templates`
* **cd ../**: Goes back a directory to the parent folder.
* **mkdir FOLDERNAME**: Creates a directory in the current folder. For example:
  `mkdir templates`
* **touch FILENAME.EXT**: Creates a blank file in the format indicated. For
  example: `touch index.html` or `touch views.py`
